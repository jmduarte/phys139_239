    "The primary difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch is that the networks (or graphs) that TensorFlow generates are static while the networks for PyTorch are dynamic (see TensorFlow Fold for dynamic graphs).\n",
    "This means that with PyTorch one can modify and adjust the network on-the-fly (e.g., making it easier to adjust for changes in the input dimensionality or number of input nodes within a network). \n",
